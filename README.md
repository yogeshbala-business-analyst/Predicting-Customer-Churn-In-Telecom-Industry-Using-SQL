# Predicting-Customer-Churn-In-Telecom-Industry-Using-SQL
## Problem Statement:
This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze
Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom Industry Data Set The project involves setting up a Customer_Churn database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries.

## Objectives
Set up a  Customer_Churn database : Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Data Set Explanation:
Explain the content and context of the dataset(s), including any preprocessing steps required.
- Content: The dataset includes demographic information, account information, and service usage details of telecom customers.
- Context: The dataset aims to predict customer churn, where 'Churn' is the target variable indicating whether a customer has left the service.
The dataset includes customer-related information such as demographic details, service usage patterns, billing information, and churn status. Preprocessing steps might include:
Handling missing values.
Normalizing numerical features.
Splitting data into relevant subsets for analysis.
